"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl), who lives in NC http://t.co/pvEmE5pEVN"
"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
"@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."
"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
"Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems."
"@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt."
"If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds."

What makes this incredibly unjust is that the Model S to date has the best safety record of any car on the road (no injuries or deaths ever)
Tesla is also extending the Model S warranty to cover any fire damage even if due solely to a driver accident

Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
"Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80,000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon)."

Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.
"Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ..."
"If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt"
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
"Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch."
"Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk."
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
"The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower &amp; weighs 160 lbs"
All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.

Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site

"@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."

Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don't get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
"@plot_qasc It's only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
